# Getting Started

## User Definitions

Before we dig into how to use the application it's important to understand what level of user you are. There are two levels of user in the app:

1. Site user
2. Admin user
    
    Examples of admin users are:

    2.1. Contract Advisor<br>
    2.2. Helpdesk<br>
    2.3. Professional Practice<br>
    2.4. OCC Health Lead<br>

If you are an Admin user and don't already have credentials for the application please email [help@blastramp.com](mailto:help@blastramp.com) to request your username and password.

If you are a site user wanting to place an order and you haven't registered yet, follow the site user registration instructions below.

If you are a site user returning to the site and want to place an order, follow the logging in instructions below.

# Orders Workflow

There is a slightly different workflow for each of the admin roles. The user journeys for each of the the roles are outlined below.

## Contract Advisors

If a site is contracted and an order is requested for that site the first step in the approval process is for the Contract Advisor to review the order and accept, edit or deny it.

Once the contracted site's order has been reviewed and accepted by the CA it advances to the next step to be reviewed by the Helpdesk.

## Helpdesk Users

When either an order is submitted for a contracted site and then reviewed and approved by a CA or an order is submitted for a non contracted site, the order is listed as pending in the helpdesk users' orders list.

At this point the Helpdesk user can edit, approve or deny the order. Once the order has been approved by Helpdesk it progresses to the next step where Professional Practice or OCC Health Lead finalize the order.

## Professional Practice

Once an order has been approved by Helpdesk it will show in the Professional Practice orders list as a pending order. At this point Professional Practice can edit, approve or deny the PPE items of the form (previously referred to as part A of the paper order form).

Once the PPE items on the form are approved an order is generated in Blast Ramp for the only the those PPE items.

## OCC Health Lead

Once an order has been approved by Helpdesk it will show in the OCC Health Lead orders list as a pending order. At this point OCC Health Leads can edit, approve or deny the N95 items of the form (previously referred to as part C of the paper order form).

Once the N95 items on the form are approved an order is generated in Blast Ramp for the only the those n95 items.
